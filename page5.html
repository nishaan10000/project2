    <h1>Uses</h1>
    <p>
      NFTs have been used as a means of exchanging digital tokens that link to a
      digital file. Ownership of an NFT is often associated with a license to
      use the underlying digital asset, but generally does not confer copyright
      to the buyer. Some agreements only grant a license for personal,
      non-commercial use, while other licenses also allow commercial use of the
      underlying digital asset. <br />
    </p>
    <h3>Digital art</h3>
    <p>
      Digital art is a common use case for NFTs. High-profile auctions of NFTs
      linked to digital art have received considerable public attention, with
      the work "Merge" by artist Pak being the most expensive NFT with a price
      of $91.8 millionand Everydays: the First 5000 Days, by artist Mike
      Winkelmann (known professionally as Beeple), the second most expensive
      auction at US$69.3 million in 2021. <br />

      Some NFT collections, including EtherRocks and CryptoPunks are examples of
      generative art, where many different images can be created by assembling a
      selection of simple picture components in different combinations. In March
      2021, the blockchain company Injective Protocol bought a $95,000 original
      screen print entitled Morons (White) from English graffiti artist Banksy,
      and filmed somebody burning it with a cigarette lighter, with the video
      being minted and sold as an NFT. The person who destroyed the artwork, who
      called themselves "Burnt Banksy", described the act as a way to transfer a
      physical work of art to the NFT space. <br />

      American curator and art historian Tina Rivers Ryan, who specializes in
      digital works, has said that art museums are widely not convinced that
      NFTs represent "lasting cultural relevance." Ryan has compared NFTs to the
      net art fad before the dot-com bubble.[40][41] No centralized means of
      authentication exists to prevent stolen and counterfeit digital works from
      being sold as NFTs, although auction houses like Sotheby's, Christie's and
      various museums and galleries worldwide started collaborations and
      partnerships with digital artists such as Refik Anadol, Dangiuz and Sarah
      Zucker, selling NFTs associated with digital artworks (via NFT platforms)
      and showcasing those artworks (associated to the respective NFTs) both in
      virtual galleries and real life screens, monitors and TVs. <br />
    </p>

    <h3>Games</h3>

    <p>
      NFTs can be used to represent in-game assets, such as digital plots of
      land, which some commentators describe as being controlled "by the user"
      instead of the game developer by allowing assets to be traded on
      third-party marketplaces without permission from the game developer.
      <br />

      CryptoKitties was an early successful blockchain online game where players
      adopt and trade virtual cats. The monetization of NFTs within the game
      raised a $12.5 million investment, with some kitties selling for over
      $100,000 each.Following its success, CryptoKitties was added to the
      ERC-721 standard, which was created in January 2018 (and finalized in
      June).[A similar NFT-based online game, Axie Infinity, was launched in
      March 2018.
      <br />

      In October 2021, developer Valve banned applications that use blockchain
      technology or NFTs to exchange value or game artifacts from their Steam
      platform. <br />

      In December 2021, Ubisoft announced Ubisoft Quartz, "an NFT initiative
      which allows people to buy artificially scarce digital items using
      cryptocurrency". The announcement has raised significant criticism, with a
      dislike ratio of 96% over the YouTube announcement video, which has since
      been unlisted. Some Ubisoft developers have also raised their concern over
      the announcement. The Game Developers Conference's 2022 annual report
      stated that 70 percent of developers surveyed said their studios had no
      interest in integrating NFTs or cryptocurrency into their games. <br />

      Some luxury brands have minted NFTs for online video game cosmetics. In
      November 2021, Morgan Stanley published a note suggesting that this use
      could become a multi-billion dollar market by 2030. <br />

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
      In February 2021, NFTs reportedly generated around $25 million within the
      music industry, with artists selling artwork and music as NFT tokens. On
      February 28, 2021, electronic dance musician 3LAU sold a collection of 33
      NFTs for a total of $11.7 million to commemorate the three-year
      anniversary of his Ultraviolet album. On March 3, 2021, an NFT was made to
      promote the Kings of Leon album When You See Yourself.[63][64][65] Other
      musicians that have used NFTs include American rapper Lil Pump, Grimes,
      visual artist Shepard Fairey in collaboration with record producer Mike
      Dean,and rapper Eminem. <br />

    <h3>Film</h3>

    <p>
      >In May 2018, 20th Century Fox partnered with Atom Tickets and released
      limited-edition Deadpool 2 digital posters to promote the film. They were
      available from OpenSea and the GFT exchange.[72][73] In March 2021 Adam
      Benzine's 2015 documentary Claude Lanzmann: Spectres of the Shoah became
      the first motion picture and documentary film to be auctioned as an NFT.
      <br />
      Other projects in the film industry using NFTs include the announcement
      that an exclusive NFT artwork collection will be released for Godzilla vs.
      Kong and director Kevin Smith announcing in April 2021 that his
      forthcoming horror movie Killroy Was Here would be released as an NFT. The
      2021 film Zero Contact, directed by Rick Dugdale and starring Anthony
      Hopkins, was also released as an NFT. <br />

      In April 2021, an NFT associated with the score of the movie Triumph,
      composed by Gregg Leonard, was minted as the first NFT for a feature film
      score. <br />

      In November 2021, film director Quentin Tarantino released seven NFTs
      based on uncut scenes of Pulp Fiction. Miramax subsequently filed a
      lawsuit claiming that their film rights were violated. <br />
    </p>

    <h3>Other associated files</h3>

    <p>
      A number of internet memes have been associated with NFTs, which were
      minted and sold by their creators or by their subjects. Examples include
      Doge, an image of a Shiba Inu dog,[ as well as Charlie Bit My Finger,[83]
      Nyan Cat and Disaster Girl. <br />

      Some virtual worlds, often marketed as metaverses, have incorporated NFTs
      as a means of trading virtual items and virtual real estate. <br />

      Some pornographic works have been sold as NFTs, though hostility from NFT
      marketplaces towards pornographic material has presented significant
      drawbacks for creators. <br />

      In May 2021, UC Berkeley announced that it would be auctioning NFTs for
      the patent disclosures for two Nobel Prize-winning inventions: CRISPR-Cas9
      gene editing and cancer immunotherapy. The university will continue to own
      the patents for these inventions, as the NFTs relate only to the
      university patent disclosure form, an internal form used by the university
      for researchers to disclose inventions. <br />

      The first credited political protest NFT ("Destruction of Nazi Monument
      Symbolizing Contemporary Lithuania") was a video filmed by Professor
      Stanislovas Tomas on April 8, 2019, and minted on March 29, 2021. In the
      video, Tomas uses a sledgehammer to destroy a state-sponsored Lithuanian
      plaque located on the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences honoring Nazi war
      criminal Jonas Noreika. <br />

      In 2020, CryptoKitties developer Dapper Labs released the NBA TopShot
      project, which allowed for purchasing NFTs that linked to basketball
      highlights. The project was built on top of the Flow blockchain. <br />
    </p>

    <h3>Speculation</h3>

    <p>
      NFTs representing certain digital collectables and artworks have seen
      considerable use as a speculative asset. The NFT buying surge was called
      an economic bubble by experts, who also compared it to the Dot-com bubble.
      In March 2021 Mike Winkelmann called NFTs an "irrational exuberance
      bubble". By mid-April 2021, demand appeared to have substantially
      subsided, causing prices to fall significantly. Financial theorist William
      J. Bernstein has compared the NFT market to 17th century tulip mania,
      saying how any speculative bubble requires a technological advance for
      people to "get excited about", with part of that enthusiasm coming from
      the extreme predictions being made about the product. <br />

      Money laundering NFTs, as with other blockchain securities and traditional
      art sales, can potentially be utilized for money laundering. Auction
      platforms for NFT sales may potentially face regulatory pressure for
      compliance with existing anti-money laundering legislation. Gou Wenjun,
      the director of the Anti-Money Laundering Monitoring and Analysis Centre
      for the People's Bank of China, has expressed that NFTs could "easily
      become money-laundering tools." Gou elaborated that there is an increasing
      unlawful exploitation of various new cryptographic technologies, and that
      illicit actors often self-identify as innovators of the financial
      technology sector.
      <br />
      A February 2022 study from the United States Treasury assessed that there
      was "some evidence of money laundering risk in the high-value art market,"
      including through "the emerging digital art market, such as the use of
      non-fungible tokens (NFTs)."The study considered how NFT transactions may
      be a simpler option for laundering money through art by avoiding the
      transportation or insurance complications in trading physical art. Several
      NFT exchanges were labeled as possible virtual asset service providers
      that may be subject to Financial Crimes Enforcement Network regulations.

    <h3>Other uses</h3>

    <p>
      In 2019, Nike patented a system called CryptoKicks that would use NFTs to
      verify the authenticity of physical sneakers and give a virtual version of
      the shoe to the customer. <br />

      Tickets, for any type of event, have been suggested for sale as NFTs.Such
      proposals would enable event organizers or performers to garner royalties
      on resales. <br />

      Some private online communities have been formed around the confirmed
      ownership of certain NFT releases. <br />

      In February 2022 a woman bought a five-bedroom, three-and-half-bath house
      near Tampa Bay, Florida for 210 Ether, the equivalent of $653,000 at the
      time of the sale in an auction. The sale transferred ownership of the
      house from the seller to a limited liability company, after the auction
      finished ownership of the LLC was automatically transferred to the winner
      and the seller received the crypto payment in her digital wallet. <br />
