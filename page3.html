    <h1>Standards in blockchains</h1>
    <p>
      Specific token standards have been created to support various blockchain
      use-cases. Ethereum was the first blockchain to support NFTs with its
      ERC-721 standard and is currently the most widely used. Many other
      blockchains have added or plan to add support for NFTs with their growing
      popularity.
    </p>
    <h2>Ethereum</h2>
    <p>
      ERC-721 was the first standard for representing non-fungible digital
      assets on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-721 is an inheritable Solidity
      smart contract standard, meaning that developers can create new
      ERC-721-compliant contracts by copying from a reference implementation.
      ERC-721 provides core methods that allow tracking the owner of a unique
      identifier, as well as a permissioned way for the owner to transfer the
      asset to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ERC-1155 standard offers "semi-fungibility", as well as providing an
      analogue to ERC-721 functionality (meaning that an ERC-721 asset could be
      built using ERC-1155). Unlike ERC-721 where a unique ID represents a
      single asset, the unique ID of an ERC-1155 token represent a class of
      assets, and there is an additional quantity field to represent the amount
      of the class that a particular wallet has. The assets under the same class
      are interchangeable, and the user can transfer any amount of assets to
      others.

      <li>Bitcoin Cash supports NFTs.</li>
      <li>
        Cardano introduced native tokens that enable the creation of NFTs
        without smart contracts with its March 2021 update.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Flow blockchain, which uses a proof of stake consensus model,
        supports NFTs. CryptoKitties had announced plans to switch from Ethereum
        to Flow in the "near future", in March 2021.
      </li>
      <li>The Solana blockchain also supports non-fungible tokens.</li>
      <li>
        Tezos is a blockchain network that operates on proof of stake and
        supports the sale of NFT art
