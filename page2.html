    <h4>Early history (2014–2017)</h4>
    <p>
      The first known "NFT", Quantum, was created by Kevin McCoy and Anil Dash
      in May 2014, consisting of a video clip made by McCoy's wife, Jennifer.
      McCoy registered the video on the Namecoin blockchain and sold it to Dash
      for $4, during a live presentation for the Seven on Seven conference at
      the New Museum in New York City. McCoy and Dash referred to the technology
      as "monetized graphics". A non-fungible, tradable blockchain marker was
      explicitly linked to a work of art, via on-chain metadata (enabled by
      Namecoin). This is in contrast to the multi-unit, fungible, metadata-less
      "colored coins" of other blockchains and Counterparty. <br />

      In October 2015, the first NFT project, Etheria, was launched and
      demonstrated at DEVCON 1 in London, Ethereum's first developer conference,
      three months after the launch of the Ethereum blockchain. Most of
      Etheria's 457 purchasable and tradable hexagonal tiles went unsold for
      more than five years until March 13, 2021, when renewed interest in NFTs
      sparked a buying frenzy. Within 24 hours, all tiles of the current version
      and a prior version, each hardcoded to 1 ETH ($0.43 at the time of
      launch), were sold for a total of $1.4 million. The term "NFT" only gained
      currency with the ERC-721 standard, first proposed in 2017 via the
      Ethereum GitHub, following the launch of various NFT projects that year.
      The standard coincided with the launch of several NFT projects, including
      Curio Cards, CryptoPunks (a project to trade unique cartoon characters,
      released by the American studio Larva Labs on the Ethereum blockchain) and
      rare Pepe trading cards. <br />

    <h4>Increased public awareness (2017–present)</h4>
    <p>
      The 2017 online game Crypto Kitties was monetized by selling tradable cat
      NFTs, and its success brought some public attention to NFTs. <br />
      The NFT market experienced rapid growth during 2020, with its value
      tripling to $250 million. In the first three months of 2021, more than
      $200 million were spent on NFTs. <br />

      In 2020, the U.S Patent and Trademark Office received 3 trademark
      applications for NFTs. In 2021, the number of trademark applications
      jumped to over 1200.In January of 2022, the U.S. Patent and Trademark
      Office received 450 NFT-related trademark applications. The growing list
      of brands being trademarked for NFTs includes the NYSE, Star Trek, Panera,
      Walmart, Elvis Presley, Sports Illustrated, Ticketmaster, and Yahoo.
      <br />

      In the early months of 2021, interest in NFTs increased after a number of
      high-profile sales and art auctions.
