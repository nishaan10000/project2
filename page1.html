    <h1>What is Nft</h1>
    <p>
      A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on
      a blockchain, a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded. Types
      of NFT data units may be associated with digital files such as photos,
      videos, and audio. Because each token is uniquely identifiable, NFTs
      differ from blockchain cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. <br />
      <br />

      NFT ledgers claim to provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof
      of ownership, but the legal rights conveyed by an NFT can be uncertain.
      NFTs do not restrict the sharing or copying of the underlying digital
      files, do not necessarily convey the copyright of the digital files, and
      do not prevent the creation of NFTs with identical associated files.
      <br />

      NFTs have been used as a speculative asset, and they have drawn increasing
      criticism for the energy cost and carbon footprint associated with
      validating blockchain transactions as well as their frequent use in art
      scams and claimed structure of the NFT market to be a Ponzi scheme. <br />
      <br />
      An NFT is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain,
      which can be sold and traded. The NFT can be associated with a particular
      digital or physical asset (such as a file or a physical object) and a
      license to use the asset for a specified purpose. An NFT (and, if
      applicable, the associated license to use, copy or display the underlying
      asset) can be traded and sold on digital markets. The extralegal nature of
      NFT trading usually results in an informal exchange of ownership over the
      asset that has no legal basis for enforcement, often conferring little
      more than use as a status symbol. <br />
      <br />
      NFTs function like cryptographic tokens, but unlike cryptocurrencies such
      as Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFTs are not mutually interchangeable, hence not
      fungible. While all bitcoins are equal, each NFT may represent a different
      underlying asset and thus may have a different value. NFTs are created
      when blockchains string records of cryptographic hash, a set of characters
      identifying a set of data, onto previous records, therefore, creating a
      chain of identifiable data blocks. This cryptographic transaction process
      ensures the authentication of each digital file by providing a digital
      signature that is used to track NFT ownership. However, data links that
      point to details such as where the art is stored can be affected by link
      rot Ownership of an NFT does not inherently grant copyright or
      intellectual property rights to the digital asset a token represents.
      <br />
      <br />
      While someone may sell an NFT representing their work, the buyer will not
      necessarily receive copyright privileges when ownership of the NFT is
      changed and so the original owner is allowed to create more NFTs of the
      same work. In that sense, an NFT is merely proof of ownership separate
      from copyright. According to legal scholar Rebecca Tushnet, "In one sense,
      the purchaser acquires whatever the art world thinks they have acquired.
      They definitely do not own the copyright to the underlying work unless it
      is explicitly transferred." <br />
