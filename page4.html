    <h1>Storage off-chain</h1>
    <p>
      NFTs involving digital art generally do not store the associated artwork
      file on the blockchain due to its size. The token functions in a way more
      similar to a certificate of ownership, with a web address pointing to the
      piece of art in question, making the art still subject to link rot.
      Because NFTs are functionally separate from the underlying artworks,
      anybody can easily save a copy of an NFT's image, popularly through a
      right click. NFT supporters disparage this duplication of NFT artwork as a
      "right-clicker mentality", with one collector quoted by Vice comparing the
      value of a purchased NFT to that of a status symbol "to show off that they
      can afford to pay that much". <br />

      The "right-clicker mentality" phrase spread virally after its
      introduction, particularly among those that were critical of the NFT
      marketplace who used the term to flaunt the ability to capture digital art
      backed by NFT with ease.This criticism was promoted by Australian
      programmer Geoffrey Huntley who created "The NFT Bay", modeled after The
      Pirate Bay. The NFT Bay advertised a torrent file purported to contain 19
      terabytes of digital art NFT images. Huntley compared his work to an art
      project from Pauline Pantsdown, and hoped the site would help educate
      users on what NFTs are and are not. <br />

    <h2>Environmental concerns</h2>

    <p>
      NFT purchases and sales are enmeshed in a controversy regarding the high
      energy usage, and consequent greenhouse gas emissions, associated with
      blockchain transactions.A major aspect of this is the proof-of-work
      protocol required to regulate and verify blockchain transactions on
      networks such as Ethereum, which consumes a large amount of electricity;
      estimating the carbon footprint of a given NFT transaction involves a
      variety of assumptions about the manner in which that transaction is set
      up on the blockchain, the economic behavior of blockchain miners (and the
      energy demands of their mining equipment), as well as the amount of
      renewable energy being used on these networks. There are also conceptual
      questions, such as whether the carbon footprint estimate for an NFT
      purchase should incorporate some portion of the ongoing energy demand of
      the underlying network, or just the marginal impact of that particular
      purchase. An analogy that's been described for this is the footprint
      associated with an additional passenger on a given airline flight. <br />

      Some more recent NFT technologies use alternative validation protocols,
      such as proof of stake, that have much less energy usage for a given
      validation cycle. Other approaches to reducing electricity include the use
      of off-chain transactions as part of minting an NFT.A number of NFT art
      sites are also looking to address these concerns, and some are moving to
      using technologies and protocols with lower associated footprints.Others
      now allow the option of buying carbon offsets when making NFT purchases,
      although the environmental benefits of this have been questioned. In some
      instances, NFT artists have decided against selling some of their own work
      to limit carbon emission contributions. <br />

      Artist and buyer fees Sales platforms charge artists and buyers fees for
      minting, listing, claiming and secondary sales. Analysis of NFT markets in
      March 2021, in the immediate aftermath of Beeple's Everydays: the First
      5000 Days" selling for US$69.3 million, found that most NFT artworks were
      selling for less than $200, with a third selling for less than $100. Those
      selling below $100 were paying platform fees between 72.5% and 157.5% of
      that amount. In average the fees make 100.5% of the price, meaning that
      such artists were on average paying more money in fees than they were
      making in sales. <br />
    </p>

    <h3>Plagiarism and fraud</h3>

    <p>
      There have been cases of artists having their work sold by others as an
      NFT, without permission.[After the artist Qing Han died in 2020, her
      identity was assumed by a fraudster and a number of her works became
      available for purchase as NFTs. Similarly, a seller posing as Banksy
      succeeded in selling an NFT supposedly made by the artist for $336,000 in
      2021; with the seller in this case refunding the money after the case drew
      media attention. <br />

      The general ease of creating plagiarized NFT works, along with the
      anonymity of minting NFTs, has made it harder to pursue legal action
      against NFT plagiarists. <br />

      A process known as "sleepminting" can also allow a fraudster to mint an
      NFT in an artist's wallet and transfer it back to their own account
      without the artist becoming aware. This allowed a white hat hacker to mint
      a fraudulent NFT that had seemingly originated from the wallet of the
      artist Beeple.
      <br />
      Plagiarism concerns have led the art website DeviantArt to create a bot
      that searches and compares user art to art on popular NFT marketplaces. If
      the bot finds art that is similar, it warns the user and instructs the
      user how they can contact NFT marketplaces to request that they take down
      their plagiarized work. <br />

      Some NFT marketplaces have responded to cases of plagiarism by creating
      "takedown teams" to respond to artist complaints. The NFT marketplace
      OpenSea has rules against plagiarism and deepfakes (which it labels as
      non-consensual intimate imagery). Some artists have criticized OpenSea's
      current efforts to deal to plagiarism saying they are slow to respond to
      takedown requests and are subject to support scams from users who claim to
      be representatives from the platform. Other argue that there is currently
      a lack of market incentive for NFT marketplaces to crack down on
      plagiarism.
      <br />
      The BBC reported a case of insider trading when an employee of the NFT
      marketplace OpenSea bought specific NFTs before they were launched, with
      the prior knowledge they would be promoted on the company's home page. NFT
      trading is an unregulated market that has no legal recourse for such
      abuses.
      <br />
      In their announcement of developing NFT support for the graphics editor
      Photoshop, Adobe proposed creating an InterPlanetary File System database
      as an alternative means of establishing authenticity for digital works.
      <br />
      The price paid for specific NFTs and sales volume of a particular author
      may be artificially inflated due to wash trading, which is prevalent due
      to a lack of government regulation on NFTs. <br />
    </p>

    <h4>Security</h4>

    <p>
      In January 2022, it was reported that some NFTs were being used to mine
      user IP addresses by the seller. <br />
    </p>

    <h4>Pyramid/Ponzi scheme claims</h4>

    <p>
      The structure of the NFT market has been seen by some as being similar to
      a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, where early adopters profit at the expense of
      those buying in later.
